# Markdown Pokédex

The Pokédex (Pokémon Encyclopedia) is an electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. The name Pokédex is a portmanteau of Pokémon and index. In the video games, whenever a Pokémon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pokédex. Each region has its own Pokédex, which differ in appearance, species of Pokémon catalogued, and functions. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, which takes place long before any other Pokémon games, players are tasked with assembling the first ever Pokédex.

The [National Pokédex](national_pokedex.md) allows Pokémon from all regions to be catalogued.

This repository contains a Pokémon Pokédex in markdown format. It was generated from [Veekun's Pokédex](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) by converting the CSV format Pokédex to Markdown using a script I wrote for [Asciiville](https://github.com/doctorfree/Asciiville.git).

## Usage

This repository is organized as an Obsidian vault containing the Pokédex in markdown format. It can be viewed using any markdown viewer but if Obsidian is used then many additional features will be available including queries using the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### **For the optimal experience, open this vault in Obsidian!**

1. [Download the vault](https://github.com/doctorfree/Pokedex-Markdown/releases/latest)
3. Open the vault in Obsidian via "Open another vault -> Open folder as vault"
4. Trust us. :) 
5. When Obsidian opens the settings, hit the switch on "Dataview" to enable the plugin
6. Done! The Markdown Pokédex vault is now available to you in its purest and most useful form!

### Release Notes

The full Release Notes for the current version of the Markdown Pokédex can be found in [release_notes.md](release_notes.md).

### Pokédex Queries

The Markdown Pokédex has been curated with metadata allowing queries to be performed using the Obsidian Dataview plugin. Sample queries along with the code used to perform them can be viewed in the [Pokédex Queries](pokedex_queries.md) document.

Included here as well is an `.obsidian` directory populated with my [Doctorfree Obsidian Theme](https://github.com/doctorfree/Obsidian-Doctorfree) and other [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) initialization. We recommend using Obsidian to browse, view, edit, and manage this repository. Obsidian is not open source but it is free and there is a rich set of community contributed plugins and themes that are open source.
