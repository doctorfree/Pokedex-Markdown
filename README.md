# Markdown Pokédex

The Pokédex (Pokémon Encyclopedia) is an electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. The name Pokédex is a portmanteau of Pokémon and index. In the video games, whenever a Pokémon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pokédex. Each region has its own Pokédex, which differ in appearance, species of Pokémon catalogued, and functions. In **Pokémon Legends: Arceus**, which takes place long before any other Pokémon games, players are tasked with assembling the first ever Pokédex.

This repository contains a Pokémon Pokédex in markdown format. It was generated from [Veekun's Pokédex](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) by converting the CSV format Pokédex to Markdown using a script I wrote for [Asciiville](https://github.com/doctorfree/Asciiville.git).

**[Note:]** Some of these markdown files are quite large. Some markdown viewers/editors perform an indexing of all markdown documents in the "vault" or collection. This indexing operation may consume quite a bit of time. Hopefully your markdown viewer/editor is smart enough to perform the indexing only once (e.g. Obsidian will only perform indexing when the vault is initially added). The largest markdown files were split using the [markdown split script](split_markdown.md) but several remain over 1MB.

Included here as well is an `.obsidian` directory populated with my [Doctorfree Obsidian Theme](https://github.com/doctorfree/Obsidian-Doctorfree) and other [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) initialization. We recommend using Obsidian to browse, view, edit, and manage this repository. Obsidian is not open source but it is free and there is a rich set of community contributed plugins and themes that are open source.
