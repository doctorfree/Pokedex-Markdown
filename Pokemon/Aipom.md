**Aipom** (Eipamu &#x30a8;&#x30a4;&#x30d1;&#x30e0;) appears as a purple monkey with a hand on its tail, it uses its hand like tail more than its real ones. It makes its nest high in the trees. When it sees its favorite food, a Bounsweet, It excitedly pounces. Ash once had an Aipom that he traded to Dawn which evolved later in the anime.
