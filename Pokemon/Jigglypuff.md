**Jigglypuff**, known in Japan as Purin (&#x30d7;&#x30ea;&#x30f3;), is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species. Jigglypuff first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Jigglypuff is voiced by Rachael Lillis in English and by Mika Kanai in Japanese. In the live-action musical Pok&#x00e9;mon Live!, Jigglypuff is portrayed by Leah Smith. Jigglypuff is also very well known for singing a lullaby in the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime series.

Known as the Balloon Pok&#x00e9;mon, Jigglypuff evolves from [Igglybuff](Igglybuff.md) when it reaches a certain point of happiness, and evolves into [Wigglytuff](Wigglytuff.md) when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its English name is a combination of the words "jiggly" and "puff", intended to relate to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the anime series and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the Pok&#x00e9;mon series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pok&#x00e9;mon Trading Card Game. It also has appeared as a playable character in every entry of the Super Smash Bros. series.

Jigglypuff can inflate its body like a balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is accompanied by a distinctive "honk" sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes and, if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.
