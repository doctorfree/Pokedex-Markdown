**Eevee** (&#x30a4;&#x30fc;&#x30d6;&#x30a4;, &#x012a;bui) is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Motofumi Fujiwara, it first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue. It has later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, as well as animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It is also the game mascot and starter Pok&#x00e9;mon for Pok&#x00e9;mon: Let's Go, Eevee!

Known as the Evolution Pok&#x00e9;mon in the games and the anime, Eevee has an unstable genetic code, which allows it to evolve into one of eight different Pok&#x00e9;mon, known as Eeveelutions, depending on the situation. The first three of these evolutions, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, were introduced alongside Eevee in Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue. Five more evolutions have since been introduced in Pok&#x00e9;mon games: Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon.

Eevee is a mammalian creature with brown fur, a bushy tail that has a cream-colored tip, and a furry collar that is also cream-colored. Eevee has brown eyes, big ears, and pink paw pads. Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure, enabling it to evolve into multiple Pok&#x00e9;mon. Eevee are quite rare in the games, but are canonically able to live almost anywhere, as they may evolve to suit their surroundings.

## Evolutions

Eevee is best known for being the Pok&#x00e9;mon with the most potential evolutions (dubbed "eeveelutions" by fans, though it later came to be used in official capacities), with eight possible evolutionary forms (followed by [Tyrogue](Tyrogue.md), with three). In the first generation of Pokemon games where Eevee was introduced, it was also the only to have branched evolutions. All the Eeveelutions were designed by Atsuko Nishida, except for Jolteon and Flareon, which were designed by Motofumi Fujiwara.
