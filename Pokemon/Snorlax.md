**Snorlax**, known in Japan as Kabigon (&#x30ab;&#x30d3;&#x30b4;&#x30f3;), is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species, a type of Pocket Monster, in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Snorlax first appeared in the Game Boy video game Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue, and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spin-off titles, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Snorlax is a large, blueish creature with closed slit eyes and a closed mouth that features two upwardly protruding teeth.

Snorlax is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in the Japanese versions of the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime and the Super Smash Bros. series of video games, and by Hitoshi Takagi and Mitsuru Ogata in the animated shorts Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Pikachu & Pichu, respectively. In its English-language appearances, it was originally voiced by Michael Haigney, and later Eric Stuart.

Known as the "Sleeping Pok&#x00e9;mon", Snorlax has been said to weigh over 1,000 pounds (450 kg) and, until Pok&#x00e9;mon Ruby and Sapphire, was considered the heaviest known Pok&#x00e9;mon ever discovered. Since its debut, Snorlax has received a generally positive reception, and is one of the most popular Pok&#x00e9;mon, especially in the Kanto region due to its cuteness.

Snorlax is a noseless ursid-like Pok&#x00e9;mon that has a cream-colored face, hands and feet, while the rest of its body is teal in color. Its head is also large, and it has two small canine teeth visibly protruding from its lower jaw. Its feet are large compared to most Pok&#x00e9;mon, which assist its balance when it chooses to stand. Although Snorlax's arms are short in relation to its size, they are long enough to enable it to both grab food and eat. Snorlax has been said to weigh over 1,000 pounds, and for a time was considered the heaviest known Pok&#x00e9;mon. Due to having an enormous appetite, Snorlax will devour almost anything, even moldy and rotten food. Thanks to its extremely strong digestive juices, Snorlax's stomach can dissolve any kind of poison. As a result, it can eat tainted food without worry.

Despite its size, Snorlax is such a docile Pok&#x00e9;mon that children use its large belly as a place to play. Snorlax has hidden potential to unleash tremendous power when holding the Snorlium Z item, however, which gives access to its signature Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake. Snorlax has a pre-evolution, [Munchlax](Munchlax.md), which is obtainable via breeding a Snorlax that is holding Full Incense. Munchlax also sports a voracious appetite, and evolves into a Snorlax when it has a sufficiently high level of friendship with its Trainer.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
