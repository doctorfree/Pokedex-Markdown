**Meowth**, known as Nyarth (&#x30cb;&#x30e3;&#x30fc;&#x30b9;, Ny&#x0101;su) in the original Japanese version) is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Meowth first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue and subsequent entries in the franchise. In addition, it was one of the Pok&#x00e9;mon to get an Alolan Form variant of the Dark type. It now also has a Galarian Form, which is a Steel type, and is the only Pok&#x00e9;mon to have both an Alolan form and a Galarian form. It later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. A male Meowth capable of human speech is considered by many fans as Team Rocket's mascot because he is a member of the Team Rocket Trio, a group of antagonists in the anime comprising himself and two Team Rocket grunts called Jessie and James. Meowth is voiced by Inuko Inuyama in Japanese, and by Maddie Blaustein (dub episodes 33-419), and Jimmy Zoppi (dub episodes 420 &#x2013; current) in English.

Known as the Scratch Cat Pok&#x00e9;mon, it spends most of the daytime sleeping and prowls the city streets at night. Meowth evolves into [Persian](Persian.md) in Kanto and Alola and Perrserker in Galar. Meowth is considered as rival of the Pok&#x00e9;mon mascot [Pikachu](Pikachu.md) and also has the opposite Pok&#x00e9;dex number than that of Pikachu (its Pok&#x00e9;dex number being 52 while Pikachu's is 25). Meowth is among the most recognizable Pok&#x00e9;mon, largely because a member of the species is a central character in the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime series. This particular Meowth, belonging to Team Rocket, the anime's main antagonists, is one of the few Pok&#x00e9;mon that have the ability to speak human language. The episode "Go West Young Meowth" shows the character's backstory, in which Meowth attempted to impress a female Meowth called Meowzie (Madonna (&#x30de;&#x30c9;&#x30f3;&#x30cb;&#x30e3;, Madonnya) in Japanese version) by teaching himself how to walk on two legs and speak human language, but it ended up alienating Meowzie.

Meowth retract their claws back into their paws, which grants them silent movement and protecting them from leaving distinctively incriminating pawprints that alert people to their actions. Meowth loves round objects, as well as shiny, glittering things. The item it adores collecting the most, however, are coins, since they are both round and shiny. Meowth collects the objects at every opportunity and hoards in its nest. [Murkrow](Murkrow.md), a Pok&#x00e9;mon similar to the bowerbird, exhibits similar behavior and members of the two species have been known to steal from the collections of the other.

In the English version of the franchise, Team Rocket's Meowth speaks with a Brooklyn accent.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
