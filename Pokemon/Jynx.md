**Jynx**, known in Japan as Rougela (&#x30eb;&#x30fc;&#x30b8;&#x30e5;&#x30e9;, R&#x016b;jura), is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Jynx first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, or animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The character is voiced in the anime and other media in Japanese by Mayumi Tanaka and by Rachael Lillis in English.

Jynx's design and humanoid appearance has been criticized by the Western media, including cultural critic Carole Boston Weatherford, who described Jynx as representing blackface after seeing the character's depiction in the anime. Due to complaints, Game Freak modified its appearance by changing the original color of its face from black to the current color, purple.

Also known as the "Human Shape" Pok&#x00e9;mon, Jynx is a female-only species that resembles the Japanese mythical creature Yuki-onna. Originally portrayed with a black face and dark blue hands, Jynx's design was changed to purple coloration after critiques that it perpetuated racism. In addition Jynx have large pink lips, saucer-like eyes, white arms, and long, blonde hair. The "clothes" they appear to wear are actually part of their body, resembling a circular red bra and skirt. Jynx have no visible feet, and in the games leave no footprints. Jynx has a pre-evolution, [Smoochum](Smoochum.md), which evolves into Jynx when it receives enough experience from battles and reaches level 30.

Jynx Pok&#x00e9;mon walk in a dance-like fashion, wiggling their hips in a manner described in Red & Blue, as well as in Leaf Green as "seductive". It uses dancing to communicate, with the exact rhythm relying on its emotion at the time. The dance affects people, causing them to themselves dance with no regard to their actions. Jynx speak in a language that only other Jynx can understand, though the sound is described as similar to human speech. This trait is carried on to games where Pok&#x00e9;mon speak English such as the Pok&#x00e9;mon Mystery Dungeon series, with the text appearing as combinations of "X"s, "O"s, punctuation marks, and/or musical notes, instead of legible words. Jynx are psychic, and can attack either by kissing an opponent or launching "strange orbs" at them, and can protect themselves with a psychically-generated barrier.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
