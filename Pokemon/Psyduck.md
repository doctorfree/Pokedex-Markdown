**Psyduck**, known as Koduck (&#x30b3;&#x30c0;&#x30c3;&#x30af;, Kodakku) in Japan, is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Psyduck first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue and later in sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Psyduck is voiced by Rikako Aikawa in Japan and Michael Haigney in English. A Psyduck also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pok&#x00e9;mon Detective Pikachu.

Known as the duck Pok&#x00e9;mon, Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache, and usually just stands vacantly, trying to calm itself. In the anime series, Psyduck's appearances became a running gag; Misty would often release Psyduck by accident instead of the Pok&#x00e9;mon she wanted to use. Also, Misty's Psyduck has not evolved in the anime.

Psyduck resembles a yellow platypus with a vacant stare. It has a small tuft of black hair at the top of its head. It walks on its hind legs, and has arms rather than wings. Its arms are useful in using its powerful psychic abilities. Its appearance is meant to trick enemies into thinking it is weak. It has arms with three claws on each to deliver scratches if threatened. Psyduck live in freshwater lakes, small ponds, or rivers in tropical areas. When a Psyduck receives enough experience from battles, it evolves into [Golduck](Golduck.md), which appears to be based on the kappa.

Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache, and usually just stands there vacantly, trying to calm its headache. When the headache gets too bad, its brain cells awaken, allowing it to use strong psychic powers. Some use their vacant look to their advantage, lulling the enemy and then using its psychokinetic powers. Psyduck do not remember using their powers, which they use while in a state of deep sleep, so they tilt their head in confusion.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
