**Squirtle**, known as Zenigame (&#x30bc;&#x30cb;&#x30ac;&#x30e1;) in Japan, is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. It was designed by Atsuko Nishida. Its name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the English localization of the series in order to give it a "clever and descriptive name." Its name is composed of squir- from squirt and -tle from Turtle. In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by Rikako Aikawa and in English localizations by Eric Stuart, and later Michele Knotz. Squirtle, in the anime, never evolved for reasons which are never truly explained by the creators.

In the main series games, Squirtle can evolve into [Wartortle](Wartortle.md) at level 16 or 14 depending what game you are playing, which can further evolve into [Blastoise](Blastoise.md) at level 36 or 34. It is known as the "Tiny Turtle Pok&#x00e9;mon". It also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Oh and it&#x2019;s also in many different Pok&#x00e9;mon games as a Gen 1 Pok&#x00e9;mon.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
