**Lapras** (&#x30e9;&#x30d7;&#x30e9;&#x30b9;, Rapurasu) is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Lapras first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Lapras is a water-type large Pok&#x00e9;mon that resembles a plesiosaur. Lapras was voiced by Rikako Aikawa in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the anime.

Lapras, known as the Transport Pok&#x00e9;mon, is a large sea creature which resembles a plesiosaur. It may also be inspired by placodonts. It has four flippers, however its front ones are notably larger than its hind flippers. It has a long neck, and large black eyes. Lapras has unusual curled ears and a short horn in the middle of its forehead. The majority of its body is blue, while its underside is a light cream-yellow color. Its most distinguishing feature is the gray shell on its back, which is largely dotted with blunt knobs. Lapras is most known for its fondness of moving people and Pok&#x00e9;mon across bodies of water. Some Lapras are able to develop Psychic abilities such as telepathy, which makes them able to understand human speech. They keep track of their fellow pod members through use of high-pitched songs they constantly sing, much like whales. Unfortunately due to their docile nature they do not like to fight, and this has made them an easy target for hunters, which has made them very rare in the wild, due to being over hunted.
