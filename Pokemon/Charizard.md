**Charizard**, known in Japan as Lizardon (&#x30ea;&#x30b6;&#x30fc;&#x30c9;&#x30f3;, Riz&#x0101;don), is a Pok&#x00e9;mon in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Atsuko Nishida, Charizard first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue (Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Green in Japan) and subsequent sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It is known as the Flame Pok&#x00e9;mon. Shin-ichiro Miki, the actor who voices James in the original Japanese version of the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime, voices Charizard in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the anime. An orange, draconic Pok&#x00e9;mon, Charizard is the evolved form of [Charmeleon](Charmeleon.md) and the final evolution of [Charmander](Charmander.md). It also has two Mega Evolved forms, Mega Charizard X and Y, that were likely both designed by Tomohiro Kitakaze, the designer of Mega Charizard X, and are not permanent and always revert to the normal Charizard form once a battle is complete. It also has a Gigantamax form in Pok&#x00e9;mon Sword and Shield, which changes its appearance and size for 3 turns, until it is knocked out, until it is returned, or until the battle ends.

Charizard is featured in the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime series with the most recurring being from the main character Ash Ketchum. It is featured in printed adaptations such as Pok&#x00e9;mon Adventures, in the possession of Blue, one of the main characters. Charizard appears in Pok&#x00e9;mon Origins with main character Red as its trainer. In this series, Charizard is iconic, because it was the first Pok&#x00e9;mon to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X and it helped beat [Mewtwo](Mewtwo.md). Charizard has received positive reception from the media, with GamesRadar describing it as "hands-down one of the coolest Pok&#x00e9;mon out there". Charizard is the version mascot of Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts of Pok&#x00e9;mon Stadium, Pok&#x00e9;mon Ranger, Pok&#x00e9;mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, Pok&#x00e9;mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, and Pok&#x00e9;mon Super Mystery Dungeon. It has appeared in every entry of the Super Smash Bros. series, in an unplayable capacity in the first two games before becoming a playable character from Super Smash Bros. Brawl onwards. A Charizard also appears in the live-action animated film Detective Pikachu.

## Physical information

Whereas its pre-evolutions Charmander and Charmeleon are ground-bound lizard like creatures, Charizard's design is inspired by dragons, more specifically European dragons. Even though Charizard gains the Flying secondary type instead of the Dragon type upon evolving, it belongs to the Dragon Egg Group, learns Dragon moves like Dragon Claw, and has its Flying type replaced by Dragon in its "Mega Charizard X" form.

Charizard has two teal wings, with a mostly orange body and back. Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its large belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, which also features a more pronounced snout. In its "X" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its "Y" form, its appearance is influenced by that of Pteranodons, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads.

Although categorized as a fire-flying type Pokemon by physique, by its nature or attack formations Charizard has a remarkable resemblance with an actual dragon, and with the dragon type moves skill set such as Dragon Rage, Draco Meteor, Dragon Wing, Dragon Claw, Dragon Pulse, etc. Charizard can be easily marked as a Fire-Flying-Dragon type Pokemon, a very rare tri-variant combination, making it one of the most powerful Pokemon in the collection.

The video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, flying proudly around the sky and constantly seeking for powerful opponents to battle with. They can breathe intense flames that can melt any material, but will never torch a weaker foe. If Charizard becomes angry, the flame at the tip of their tail can flare up in a whitish-blue color. Because of their reckless behavior, Charizard are known to unintentionally cause wildfires. While Mega Charizard X is known for its black, toned body, hotter blue flames as well as its Dragon type, Mega Charizard Y is generally regarded for its flying prowess, with it allegedly being able to reach up to 10000 meters of altitude while flying. In Pok&#x00e9;mon Go, Charizard exists in two forms, its original form with orange body and a cream-coloured patch on its belly, and its shiny form, which is a gray body with the same cream-coloured patch on its belly. Charizard's shiny form first made its appearance in Pok&#x00e9;mon Gold and Silver, during Pok&#x00e9;mon Go's Community Day event featuring Charmander. During the Community Day event, shiny Charmander may be encountered, which can be evolved into a shiny Charmeleon, and in turn, evolved into a shiny Charizard. In Generation VIII, Charizard is capable of Gigantamaxing, a special type of Dynamaxing wherein it completely changes Charizard's form. When Gigantamaxed, Charizard's belly is all lit up, its wings are cloaked in fire, and its tail flame has grown as well. If Charizard knows any Fire-type damage dealing moves, they will be transformed into G-Max Wildfire, which deals damage for five turns. Gigantamax Charizard is best seen during battles with Galarian Champion Leon. The player can also get a Gigantamax Charizard by obtaining a Charmander in a Poke Ball in Leon's house (the Poke Ball is located in his bedroom) and evolving it into Charizard.
