**Cubone**, known in Japan as Karakara (&#x30ab;&#x30e9;&#x30ab;&#x30e9;), is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Designed by Ken Sugimori and first introduced in Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue, it is referred to as the "Lonely Pok&#x00e9;mon", as it is a Pok&#x00e9;mon that used its mother's skull as a helmet after her death. In Pok&#x00e9;mon Origins, Cubone is a child of a dead Marowak that died while defending it from Team Rocket. Numerous reviewers of the Pokemon franchise have commented that this background story makes Cubone one of the most memorable Pok&#x00e9;mon, with reviewers placing its backstory on design on a spectrum ranging from touching but sad to depressing and creepy.

Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet, and is known as the "Lonely Pok&#x00e9;mon" because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its mother. On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, a natural predator. The stains on the skull the Pok&#x00e9;mon wears are made by the tears it sheds. [Marowak](Marowak.md) is the evolved form of Cubone, once it overcomes its sadness with its mother's death. In the games, Cubone instead evolves after reaching a certain experience level. It was also stated that Marowak was Cubone's mother being killed by the Team Rocket.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
