**Mewtwo** is regarded as one of the strongest Pok&#x00e9;mon, and was the strongest in the original games in terms of stats. It is known as the "Genetic Pok&#x00e9;mon" and is a Legendary Pok&#x00e9;mon, a special group of Pok&#x00e9;mon that are very rare and usually very powerful. Mewtwo has also appeared in various animated adaptations of the franchise.

Mewtwo is the result of genetic recombination of [Mew](Mew.md)'s DNA that was born from Mew similar to real life clones. While most Pok&#x00e9;mon are hatched from eggs, Mewtwo is the only Pok&#x00e9;mon that was born.

Mewtwo is intended to be "the strongest Pok&#x00e9;mon ever". Due to genetic engineering being applied to a sample of Mew's DNA in order to fully create Mewtwo's genome, Mewtwo is an extremely powerful psychic, yet its abilities surpass Mew's due to intentional alterations to the genetic source material. As such, it can use telekinesis for flight, to shield itself, or to powerfully throw opponents aside. In addition, it is among the very few Pok&#x00e9;mon capable of human speech, doing so via telepathy, alongside [Zekrom](Zekrom.md), [Reshiram](Reshiram.md), [Zygarde](Zygarde.md), the Ultra Beast [Naganadel](Naganadel.md), [Xerneas](Xerneas.md), [Diancie](Diancie.md), [Calyrex](Calyrex.md) and [Arceus](Arceus.md). Otherwise, it conserves its energy until needed, such as against powerful opponents. In addition to its psychic abilities, Mewtwo can also regenerate, which allows it to quickly recover from near-fatal injuries. However, Mewtwo notably lacks Mew's ability to learn every single teachable move within the games.

Although Mewtwo's genome is almost identical to Mew's, the genetic engineering used to complete its creation nevertheless resulted in Mewtwo's appearance being very different in comparison to Mew's. It appears as a bipedal feline that is 6 feet 7 inches (201 cm) tall and has a light gray physique with a pronounced and girthy purple tail and abdomen, voluptuous thighs, purple irises, bulbous fingertips, toned chest, crest-like pinnae, and a tube-like mass of flesh that connects from behind its head to the center of its upper back. Its appearance has been likened to "an over sized cross of cat, squirrel and kangaroo".

Although its modified genome resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.

For the sixth and seventh generations of the Pokemon video game series, Mewtwo has two Mega Evolved forms, Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y. These can be activated if the player gives Mewtwo either the Mewtwonite X or the Mewtwonite Y.
