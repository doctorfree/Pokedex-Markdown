**Pichu** (&#x30d4;&#x30af;&#x30fc;, Pik&#x016b;) is a Pok&#x00e9;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Pichu first appeared in the video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Gold and Silver and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. There have been multiple voice actors for Pichu. The two Pichu Brothers characters were voiced by Yumi T&#x014d;ma and Satomi K&#x014d;rogi (who voiced Pichu in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate), while a spiky-eared Pichu from the film Arceus and the Jewel of Life was voiced by Sh&#x014d;ko Nakagawa and Kayzie Rogers.

Pichu, known as the "Tiny Mouse" species of Pok&#x00e9;mon, are the pre-evolved version of [Pikachu](Pikachu.md). Pichu is a small ground-dwelling rodent. Its fur is very short, and it has bright yellow coloration. The tips of its large ears are black, and it has additional black markings on its neck and short tail. They are not skilled at storing electricity, so when amused or startled, they often discharge jolts of electricity strong enough to affect adult humans. This lack of control becomes more stable as they grow older. The electricity that they do manage to keep stored is limited by their small electrical pouches in their cheeks. When the air is dry or on stormy days, they charge much more easily, leaving the sound of crackling static electricity emanating from them. They play with each other by touching tails to set off sparks, which also acts as a test of courage. They run the risk of shorting each other out, and scaring themselves into a crying fit with the flash of sparks that emanates from them.

Height is measured in decimeters (1/10th of a meter)

Weight is measured in hectograms (1/10th of a kilogram)
