**Pikachu** (&#x30d4;&#x30ab;&#x30c1;&#x30e5;&#x30a6;), is a species in the Pok&#x00e9;mon media franchise. Designed by Atsuko Nishida and Ken Sugimori, Pikachu first appeared in the 1996 Japanese video games Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Green created by Game Freak and Nintendo, which were released outside of Japan in 1998 as Pok&#x00e9;mon Red and Blue. Pikachu is a yellow, mouse-like creature with electrical abilities. It is a major character in the Pok&#x00e9;mon franchise, serving as its mascot and as a major mascot for Nintendo.

Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pok&#x00e9;mon species, largely due to its appearance in the Pok&#x00e9;mon anime television series as the companion of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue &#x014c;tani, though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the live-action animated film Pok&#x00e9;mon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.

Standing 40 centimetres (1 ft 4 in) tall, Pikachu were the first "Electric-type" Pok&#x00e9;mon created, their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity. They are creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, Pikachu can transform, or "evolve," into a [Raichu](Raichu.md) when exposed to a "Thunder Stone." In Pok&#x00e9;mon Gold and Silver, "[Pichu](Pichu.md)" was introduced as an evolutionary predecessor to Pikachu. In Pok&#x00e9;mon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; since those games, female Pikachu have an indent at the end of their tails, giving the tail a heart-shaped appearance.

Initially, both Pikachu and fellow Pok&#x00e9;mon [Clefairy](Clefairy.md) were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more "engaging". The idea of Pikachu as the mascot of the animated series was suggested by the production company OLM, Inc., which found that Pikachu was popular amongst schoolchildren and could appeal to both boys and girls, as well as their mothers. Pikachu resembled a familiar, intimate pet, and yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance. Additionally, the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pikachu was originally planned to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu.

Pikachu's design has evolved from its once-pudgy body to having a slimmer waist, straighter spine, and more defined face and neck; Sugimori has stated these design changes originated in the anime, making Pikachu easier to animate, and were adopted to the games for consistency. "Fat Pikachu" was revisited in Pok&#x00e9;mon Sword and Shield, where Pikachu received a Gigantamax Form resembling its original design.
