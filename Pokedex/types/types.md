# Types

A Pok&#x00e9;mon's type (&#x30bf;&#x30a4;&#x30d7;, taipu) is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pok&#x00e9;mon and its moves. These types interact in rock&#x2013;paper&#x2013;scissors-style relationships: Pok&#x00e9;mon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves of types they resist.

In Pok&#x00e9;mon Red, Blue, and Yellow, there were only 15 types. The Dark and Steel types were introduced in Gold and Silver, and the Fairy type was introduced in X and Y. Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.

When a Pok&#x00e9;mon uses a move that matches its type, it gains a 50% increase in power due to "STAB", a colloquial acronym for "same-type attack bonus".
