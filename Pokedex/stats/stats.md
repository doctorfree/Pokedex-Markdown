# Stats

All Pok&#x00e9;mon have six statistics (&#x80fd;&#x529b;, N&#x014d;ryoku, "Attribute") which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.

- **HP** (short for Hit Points): A Pok&#x00e9;mon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pok&#x00e9;mon Center, or with a special item. However, they can still use moves in the field.
- **Attack** (&#x3053;&#x3046;&#x3052;&#x304d;, K&#x014d;geki): Determines the strength of a Pok&#x00e9;mon's physical attacks.
- **Defense** (&#x307c;&#x3046;&#x304e;&#x3087;, B&#x014d;gyo): Determines the Pok&#x00e9;mon's resistance against physical attacks.
- **Special Attack** (&#x3068;&#x304f;&#x3053;&#x3046;, Tokuk&#x014d;): Determines the power of a Pok&#x00e9;mon's special attacks.
- **Special Defense** (&#x3068;&#x304f;&#x307c;&#x3046;, Tokub&#x014d;): Determines the Pok&#x00e9;mon's resilience to special attacks.
- **Speed** (&#x3059;&#x3070;&#x3084;&#x3055;, Subayasa): After battle commands are entered, the Speed statistics of the participating Pok&#x00e9;mon are compared. With some exceptions, Pok&#x00e9;mon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed. If the player's Pok&#x00e9;mon uses the Psychic-type move Trick Room, the player can reverse the turn order for five turns. Once Trick Room is used, slower Pok&#x00e9;mon go first and faster Pok&#x00e9;mon move last. Outside of Trick Room conditions, if two Pok&#x00e9;mon have the same speed, through an algorithm called a random number generator, a Pok&#x00e9;mon is chosen at random to go first.

There are also two other statistics, Accuracy (&#x547d;&#x4e2d;&#x7387;, Meich&#x016b;ritsu) and Evasiveness (&#x56de;&#x907f;&#x7387;, Kaihiritsu), which are not affected when Pok&#x00e9;mon level up. No Pok&#x00e9;mon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pok&#x00e9;mon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called "Evade" in the first generation and "Evasion" in the second.

In Pok&#x00e9;mon Red, Blue, and Yellow, both the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were a single stat, named the "Special" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.

When Pok&#x00e9;mon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pok&#x00e9;mon's base stat values, effort values, Pok&#x00e9;mon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each Pok&#x00e9;mon with its unique stats.
