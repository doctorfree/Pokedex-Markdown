# Contributing

The Markdown Pokédex is very much a work in progress. Although already data rich, the Pokédex is incomplete with many gaps in the data. We welcome any help you might provide.

To get started contributing, post a note in the [repository discussion section](https://github.com/doctorfree/Pokedex-Markdown/discussions) and/or [open an issue](https://github.com/doctorfree/Pokedex-Markdown/issues).

The general process of contributing to a Github project consists of:

- Fork the project
    - [Fork the Markdown Pokédex](https://github.com/doctorfree/Pokedex-Markdown)
- Create a branch in your forked repository
- Make changes locally on the branch you created
- Commit and push your changes to your forked repository
- When ready to submit your changes for review, submit a Pull Request

See the [official Github documentation on contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) for a thorough guide.

The Data School has a pretty easy to follow [guide to contributing to a Github project](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github).
