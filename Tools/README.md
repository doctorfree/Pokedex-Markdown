This is a small collection of scripts used to assist the migration of the original CSV documents to Markdown, add metadata, and fix areas where the documents were missing data.

Mostly these scripts were used once and are no longer that useful. However, they serve well as examples of how to batch manipulate Markdown documents. Currently they are primarily reference material and likely only useful to those wishing to make mass changes to the Markdown documents.

Some of what was done with these scripts is now better implemented using the Obsidian Templater plugin. I keep these around so I can copy the relevant sections in future scripts. You can safely ignore these.

Scripts include the following:

- [add-link](add-link.md)
- [addtags](addtags.md)
- [append-also](append-also.md)
- [append-info](append-info.md)
- [awk-fixup-img-links](awk-fixup-img-links.md)
- [fixmeta](fixmeta.md)
- [head](head.md)
- [insert-template](insert-template.md)
- [insert-template2](insert-template2.md)
- [install-pandoc-filters](install-pandoc-filters.md)
- [mkmd](mkmd.md)
- [pre](pre.md)
- [prepend-name](prepend-name.md)
- [remthis](remthis.md)
- [sp](sp.md)
- [tag](tag.md)
- [tagmultiple](tagmultiple.md)
- [template.md](template.md)
